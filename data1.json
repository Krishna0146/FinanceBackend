              "response": "I see where you're coming from, but that's not quite right. While infrastructure is definitely important, think about the bigger picture. The Union Budget is really about managing the entire country's finances - both what comes in and what goes out. It's like planning your household budget, but on a national scale!"

              "response": "That's exactly right! You've got a good grasp on this. Just like how we need to plan our personal finances, the government needs to carefully manage its income and spending. The Union Budget is essentially the country's financial roadmap for the year ahead. Great job understanding this fundamental concept!"

              "response": "Not quite right, but I understand why you might think that. While the Budget can influence markets, it's not its main purpose. Think of it more like the government's annual financial plan - it's about managing money coming in and going out. Would you like to explore how the Budget actually impacts markets?"

              "text": "Goods and Services Tax (GST)",
              "response": "I can see why you picked GST, but let's think about this differently. GST is actually what we call an indirect tax - it's added to the price of goods and services, and everyone pays the same rate regardless of their income. Want to know what makes a tax 'direct' versus 'indirect'?"

            {
              "text": "Income Tax",
              "response": "Excellent choice! You've got it exactly right. Income tax is indeed a direct tax because it's paid directly by the person earning the income. It's like a direct line between you and the government - the more you earn, the more you contribute. That's what makes it 'direct'. Well done understanding this key concept!"

              "text": "Customs Duty",
              "response": "Not quite right, but it's a common misconception. Customs duty is actually an indirect tax - it's paid when goods cross borders. Think about it this way: the importer pays it first, but the cost usually gets passed on to the final consumer. Would you like to explore more about how different types of taxes work?"

              "response": "Perfect answer! You've really understood this concept well. Think of it like your personal budget - if you spend more than you earn, that's a deficit. The government's fiscal deficit works the same way. It's when the government's spending exceeds its income. This understanding is crucial for grasping national economics!"

              "response": "I see where you might have gotten that idea, but let's think broader. While defense spending is important, the fiscal deficit is about ALL government spending versus income. It's like looking at your entire monthly budget, not just one expense. Would you like to explore how the government manages its overall spending?"

              "text": "The surplus generated from exports.",
              "response": "Not quite right, but I'm glad you're thinking about international trade! The fiscal deficit is actually about the government's overall finances, not just exports. Let's break it down - it's the gap between what the government earns and what it spends. Want to learn more about how international trade affects the budget?"

              "response": "While healthcare is crucial, it's not actually the top recipient. Think about what drives economic growth - what kind of foundation does a country need to build everything else upon? Infrastructure actually gets the highest allocation. Let's discuss why this might be the case!"

              "response": "Not quite - though I see why you might think that! The Economic Survey actually comes before any tax announcements. It's more like gathering all the facts and analyzing them before making decisions. Want to know more about how the Survey helps in planning the Budget?"

It's more like an annual health check-up for the economy - looking at how everything performed over the year. Trade policies are part of what it examines, but that's not its main purpose. Shall we explore its actual role?"

              "text": "Monetary Policy",
              "response": "Excellent! You've got it right. Monetary Policy is handled by the RBI, not the Union Budget. It's like having two different people manage different aspects of your finances - one handles your budget (Ministry of Finance) while another manages your investments and savings strategy (RBI). Great job distinguishing between these!"

Think of it this way: while the Finance Minister manages the government's budget, the RBI is like a separate entity managing the country's monetary system. Would you like to learn more about how they work together?"
